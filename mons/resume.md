# Profile #

I started programming when I was 10 years old and I have been addicted ever since. I enjoy architecting and implementing large scale distributed applications. Although I am experienced in front-end programming, my main focus is on the back-end, such as API servers, web server frameworks and background data processors. I also have a strong interest in computer security and use this knowledge to help my team program defensively against attacks.

I am a programming language junkie with experience in (alphabetically): Assembly (x86, MIPS), BASIC, C, C#, C++, Java, JavaScript, Lisp, Perl, Python, Ruby and Scala. I am not a zealot for any particular language; I like to use the best one for the job.

When I’m not hacking on code, I enjoy amateur photography, playing guitar and tuning my performance car.

# Professional Experience #

## SR. SOFTWARE ENGINEER, AOL, BOULDER, CO 2008-2010 ##

Socialthing was acquired by AOL in August 2008. After the transition to AOL, I worked as the architect implementing lifestream functionality into the Bebo social network. After completing this project, I became the initial architect for the AIM Lifestream project. I created the layout and framework for the entire system (web, API and feed fetching servers) and played the role of lead developer for the team of 8. I helped delegate tasks for the team and work with colleagues on designing new features and infrastructure. As of November 2009, AIM Lifestream was servicing over 500 API requests per second at peak times.

Technologies used: Java, Tomcat, Maven, MySQL, Memcached, Hadoop, Subversion, Git.

## SOFTWARE ENGINEER, SOCIALTHING, BOULDER, CO 2007-2008 ##

Socialthing was a small startup creating a first-of-its-kind digital life manager. I joined as one of the first hires and quickly became the lead developer on the three person engineering team. I architected a major refactor of the backend feed system, which helped the site scale to a larger user base. With my help in the design and direction of the product, it became one of the leading lifestream aggregation services. As the one man operations team, I configured production and development servers and acted as the primary on-call person to keep the service running 24/7. I was an active participant on the product’s support forums where I communicated directly with users.

Technologies used: Ruby, Rails, MySQL, Memcached, AWS, Subversion, Git.

## SOFTWARE ENGINEER, TYLER TECHNOLOGIES, LAKEWOOD, CO 2006-2007 ##

I worked on a team of around 10 engineers designing and implementing applications for county governments. My responsibilities included a wide range of tasks, from implementing generic tax logic that could be customized for each county, to adding user facing features to the desktop and web clients. I created and documented the remote installation and update system used for all products. I supported customers on high-priority bugs by phone, email and occasionally traveling to the site to help diagnose and solve issues. I maintained the build system used for all software products and created a website to visually display test-case runs and code coverage.

Technologies used: Java, Tomcat, Swing, JSP, Ant, Oracle, MySQL, Subversion.

## SOFTWARE ENGINEER INTERN, INTEL, COLORADO SPRINGS, CO 2005 ##

As an intern in the automation department, I configured and maintained the Windows terminal servers and developed web applications. I created a web-based firewall log summary viewer for the information security team. I worked with another developer to produce a statistical analysis program that ensured the measured data in the factory fell within the required range.

Technologies used: Perl, Apache HTTPD, C#, MS SQL Server
